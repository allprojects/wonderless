\section{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{summary}

In this paper, we introduce Wonderless, a dataset of $1,877$ 
real-world Serverless applications. Wonderless is available in two 
formats: a CSV file containing the links to the selected repositories 
in GitHub and a directory containing a snapshot of the mentioned 
repositories grouped in five different categories based on their providers. 
Researchers can use Wonderless to explore the Serverless world and 
identify its characteristics from the perspective of the open-source 
community. Wonderless can be extended in the future by adding 
Serverless applications developed by the frameworks other than 
$Serverless \; Framework$.
