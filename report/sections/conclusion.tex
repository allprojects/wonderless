\section{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{summary}

In this paper, we introduce Wonderless, a dataset of $1,877$ 
real-world Serverless applications. Wonderless is available in two 
formats: a CSV file containing the links to the selected repositories 
in GitHub and a directory containing a snapshot of the mentioned 
repositories grouped into seven different categories based on their providers. 
We believe that Wonderless can enable researchers to explore 
the characteristics of the Faas model based on a large corpus
of Serverless applications. 




% Wonderless can be extended in the future by adding 
% Serverless applications developed by the frameworks other than 
% \emph{Serverless Framework}.
