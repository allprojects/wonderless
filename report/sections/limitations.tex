\section{threats to Validity}
\label{limitations}

The main limitation of Wonderless is that it is restricted to the applications 
that are developed using the $Serverless \; Framework$. As thoroughly 
described in section\,\ref{phaseA}, $Serverless \; Framework$ is the 
most popular open-source solution for developing Serverless applications 
based on the GitHub stars and the results of a prior study\cite{kritikos2018review}. 
However, not every developer uses a framework to develop a Serverless application. 
They may directly use offerings of a provider, or they may use self-hosted solutions. 
We believe that this issue does not significantly impact the characteristics of a 
Serverless application and consequently, generalization of the dataset.

Moreover, the dataset may not be $\%100$ clean from the toy projects 
because all the steps of constructing the Wonderless are done automatically. 
For example, if a project is used for teaching or learning Serverless concepts 
and it has no text or label containing the keywords mentioned in 
section\,\ref{phaseB}, the related repository is remained in the dataset.
