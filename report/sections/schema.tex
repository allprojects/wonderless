\section{Dataset Release}
\label{schema}

The steps in Section~\ref{dataset} led to the construction of the
 Wonderless Serverless computing dataset, consisting of $1,877$
real-world Serverless applications worthing $44 \, GB$ of data. 

First, a CSV file that contains the URL of each repository. 
With this format one can clone the latest version of the repositories any time. 
On the negative side, the repositories can change access to private, 
be removed entirely, or drop the services related to Serverless computing 
over time. 

To overcome these issues, we provide a snapshot of the 
repositories taken on November 8, 2020. 
In the snapshot, each repository is assigned a directory named `$a\_b$' 
where `$a$' is the GitHub username of the developer and `$b$' is the name of the repository. 
The directories are assigned to five categories\,(AWS, Azure, Google, OpenWhisk, and Other) 
based on the provider of the applications, retrieved from the $serverless.yml$ configuration file. 
If an application used multiple providers, we placed the repository across 
all the related groups.
