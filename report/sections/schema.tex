\section{Dataset Schema}
\label{schema}

All the steps described in section\,\ref{dataset} constructed Wonderless, 
a dataset to shed light upon Serverless computing consisting of $1,913$
real-world Serverless applications worthing $44 \, GB$ of data. The dataset 
is available in the two following formats.

First, a CSV file that contains the URL of each repository. There are two 
sides to this format; On the positive side, one can clone the latest version 
of the repositories at any time. On the negative side, the repositories can 
change access to private, be removed entirely, or drop the services related 
to Serverless computing over time.

To overcome this downside, we provide a second format, a snapshot of the 
repositories taken on November 8, 2020. In the snapshot, we cloned each 
repository to a directory labeled as `$a\_b$' in which `$a$' is the GitHub 
username of the developer and `$b$' is the name of the repository. 
We analyzed the $serverless.yml$ configuration files of the repositories 
to extract the name of the provider of each application. We divided the 
directories into eight categories\,(AWS, Azure, Google, OpenWhisk, Spotinst, 
Kubeless, Cloudflare, and Fn) based on the provider of the applications. 
If an application used multiple providers, we placed the repository across 
all the related groups.
