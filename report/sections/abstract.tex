Function as a Service~\emph{(\faas)} has grown in popularity in recent years, 
with an increasing number of applications following the Serverless computing model. 
Serverless computing supports out of the box autoscaling in a pay-as-you-go manner, 
letting developers focus on the application logic rather than worrying 
about resource management.

With the increasing adoption of the this model, researchers have started 
studying a wide variety of aspects of Serverless computing, 
including communication, security, performance, and cost optimization. 
Yet, we still know very little of how Serverless computing is used in practice.

In this paper, we introduce \emph{Wonderless}, a novel dataset
of open-source Serverless applications. 
Wonderless consists of 1,877 real-world Serverless applications 
extracted from GitHub, and it can be used as a data source for 
further research in the Serverless ecosystem, such as performance 
evaluation and software mining. To the best of our knowledge, 
Wonderless is currently the most diverse and largest dataset 
for research on Serverless computing.
