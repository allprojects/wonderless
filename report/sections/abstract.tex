Function as a Service~\emph{(\faas)} has grown in popularity in recent years, 
with an increasing number of applications following the Serverless computing model. 
Serverless computing supports out of the box autoscaling in pay-as-you-go manner, 
letting developers focus on the application logic rather than worrying 
about resource management.

With the increasing adoption of the this model, researchers have started 
studying a wide variety of aspects of FaaS and Serverless computing, 
including communication, security, performance, and cost optimization. 
Yet, despite the popularity of Serverless computing, we still know very little of how it 
is used in practice.

In this paper, we introduce \emph{Wonderless}, a novel dataset
of open-source Serverless software. 
Wonderless consists of 1877 real-world Serverless applications, 
and it can be used as a data source for performance evaluation and 
software mining in the Serverless ecosystem. To the best of our knowledge, 
Wonderless is currently the most comprehensive and largest dataset
for Serverless computing research.
