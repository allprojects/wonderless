Function as a Service~\emph{(\faas)} has grown in popularity in recent years, 
with an increasing number of applications being built benefiting from Serverless 
characteristics. Serverless computing enables developers to focus on the code, and 
program in an autoscaling,  pay-as-you-go manner, without having to worry 
about resource management.

With the increase in the adoption of \faas model, research on various aspects 
of FaaS and Serverless computing is also evolving. These aspects have a wide 
variety including communication, security, cold start, and cost optimization. 
Despite its popularity, we still know very little about how Serverless computing 
is used in practice.

In this paper we introduce our methodology to construct a dataset, 
\emph{Wonderless}, for open-source Serverless applications. 
Wonderless consists of 1913 real-world Serverless applications, 
and it can be used as a data source for performance evaluation and 
trend recognition in the Serverless world. To the best of our knowledge, 
our dataset is the most comprehensive, and largest one toward a 
complete picture for Serverless development research.
