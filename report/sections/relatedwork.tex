Eismann et al. in \cite{eismann2020serverless} analyze a data source 
containing $32$ open-source projects. These projects are a subset of 
an existing dataset containing $2194$ repositories introduced by 
Pavlov et al.\cite{pavlov2019serverless}. The initial dataset was extracted 
from GitHub using GHTorrent based on keyword search and repositories' 
creation date. Eismann et al. applied several additional filters to this dataset 
to take out active and real-world Serverless applications resulting in only $32$
projects.These filters are based on the number of files, commits, 
contributors, and watchers of the projects, along with the manual walks 
through the repositories. Wonderless extends and complements 
this dataset by adding a large number of Serverless applications that 
have been collected fully automatically.

AWS SAR enables developers to store and share reusable applications. 
This repository can also be used as a dataset to investigate Serverless 
applications. However, it is bounded to AWS by only containing the 
applications provided by AWS and the applications developed by 
AWS verified authors.
